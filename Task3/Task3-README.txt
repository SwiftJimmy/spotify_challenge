Task3

1.  
    1. Number of weekly/daily active user. 
    2. Number of weekly/daily streams.
    3. Number of weekly/daily average streams per user.

2.  Visualization:
    Run Task3.py and check terminal/figures.
        
3.  Most wanted metrics:
    1. Music Categories: To get a better understand the users preferences. E.g To recommend other music.
    2. The actual playing time of a song: It would be good to know whether users listen to the complete track.
    3. Membership status: To retain existing customers and win new ones with targeted marketing campaigns.

4.  Picked metrics:
    1. Number of weekly/daily active user:
        I think it is good to know how many users use my platform.
        Paying users may be more likely to stay with Spotify if they use the service frequently. 
        Users who do not yet pay for Spotify may change their minds if they use the service frequently. 
        If the figures fall, this could be counteracted with appropriate marketing.

    2. Number of weekly/daily streams: 
        The metric shows how heavily Spotify is used in general. If we could expand this data 
        with a track category (In general: e.g podcast, music, audio book or specific: e.g rock, pop, classic), 
        this is certainly crucial to aligning Spotify's business strategy. 
        
        In adition, from historical data, you can prepare for future streaming peaks and 
        scale your IT infrastructure accordingly.
    
    3. Number of weekly/daily average streams per user:
        As far as I know, money is paid out to the artist with each stream. Accordingly, 
        it is necessary to monitor the average streams per user in order to keep an eye on Spotify's profit and, 
        if necessary, to react with a price increase if the numbers rise.
