Task3

1.  
    1. Number of weekly/daily active user. 
    2. Number of weekly/daily streams.
    3. Number of weekly/daily average streams per user.

2.  Visualization:
    Run Task3.py and check terminal/figures.
        
3.  Most wanted metrics:
    1. Music Categories: To get a better understanding of the users preferences. E.g To recommend other music.
    2. The actual playing time of a song: It would be good to know whether users listen to the complete track or when they stop. 
       This could help content creators to increase the listening time. 
    3. Membership status: To retain existing customers and win new ones with targeted marketing campaigns.

4.  Picked metrics:
    1. Number of weekly/daily active user:
        The trend gives an insight into the increase or decrease of current active users. 
        Increasing numbers could show how many new users have been addressed during last marketing campaigns and also might show a certain satisfaction of existing users
        with the service given. On the opposite when the number of users is decreasing, reasons need to be identified as well. 
        It could show that latest marketing campaigns were not successfull and are to be avoided in future. Also changes in application or services can be thought of. 

    2. Number of total weekly/daily streams: 
        The metric shows how heavily Spotify is used in general. In general when usage is heavily changing the reasons need to be analyzed. 
        During a decrease of usage, appropriate actions need to be taken. On the other hand, when numbers are increasing marketing campaigns seem to be successfull.
        If we could expand this data with a track category (In general: e.g podcast, music, audio book or specific: e.g rock, pop, classic), deeper analyzes would be 
        possible to align Spotify's business strategy. In adition, from historical data, you can prepare for future streaming peaks and scale your IT infrastructure accordingly.

    3. Number of weekly/daily average streams per user:
        As far as I know, money is paid out to the artist with each stream. Accordingly, 
        it is necessary to monitor the average streams per user in order to keep an eye on Spotify's profit and, 
        if necessary, to react with a price increase if the numbers rise.
